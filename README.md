# ðŸ”Ž LogLyzer Web Security Dashboard

## Project Overview

LogLyzer is a comprehensive Python-based **Web Log Security Analyzer** designed to process standard web server access logs. It automatically identifies suspicious or anomalous behavior and presents the findings through an interactive **Streamlit web dashboard**.

### âœ¨ Key Features

* **Security Analysis (401 Detection):** Automatically flags and aggregates requests resulting in `401 Unauthorized` responses to identify potential brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.
* **GeoIP Enrichment:** Utilizes the `geoip2` library to accurately map malicious and high-volume IP addresses to their precise geographic locations.
* **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard:** Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading logs, viewing security metrics, and visualizing data using dynamic charts powered by Plotly.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Allows users to filter all displayed results (including charts) by **IP Address** and **HTTP Status Code** via a sidebar.
